> This time, the AI seems to be quite a threat to human's survival.

Main points:
* In the future, would AI technology be stopped due to human fear?
* Why stopped? Human realizes they may not have the total control of the AI.
* Earlier in the human history: People have the control.
* Ref: [Sam Harris: Can we build AI without losing control over it?](http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_can_we_build_ai_without_losing_control_over_it)
