> This article discusses a possible framework to help the software developers read and understand requirement documents that are not-well written.

TODO:

* Define the problem.
* Define the goal.
* Describe what and how to do.

When working on a software development project, one kind of artifacts that we developers need to deal with are requirement documents. Because the requirements themselves could be potentially complex, the documents, even if the authors have already striven to write concisely, may end up being very large and full of information.

I also need to deal with such documents, and sometimes I feel pressured and directionless due to the overwhelming information, especially when there are many tiny requirements that are prone to being overlooked. In order to cope with such situation, I tried to develop a framework to help me grasp such complex documents better.

This framework is still in its early phase and I believe there will be a lot of work to be done to make it complete. Please feel free to leave me comments.

Basically, when reading the target document, I will focus on the following aspects in the document:

* Event triggers
* Data items
* Virtual resources
* Physical objects and hardware
* Human roles
