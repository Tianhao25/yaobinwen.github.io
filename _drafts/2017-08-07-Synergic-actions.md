> When you are working on a goal, make sure all your actions cooperate with and strengthen, rather than conflict with and thus weaken, each other, to produce a greater power than doing them separately.

I learned the concept "synergic actions" when reading a reply by Professor-Li's on Zhihu(a Quora-like product in China).

This morning when I was reading another book, the author says "The best material of learning is our everyday life".

I thought about why the author could find out this amazing source of learning, while I mostly consider books as the source of learning. That's when "synergic actions" occurred to me and I realize this is a natural conclusion when you apply this concept.

Here is the reasoning: I want to keep learning to improve my decision quality by evaluating my decision-making process; I spend a significant amount of time in work, and all my time in daily life; In my daily life, I make a lot of decisions. Now let's apply the "synergic actions" thinking model: How can I combine them two altogether? Boom! Right! Use my everyday life experience as the source of learning.

"Synergic actions" is a very good model of considering the daily actions: Set up the goals, set up the action plan, and make sure all the actions enhance each other to produce a more powerful result.
