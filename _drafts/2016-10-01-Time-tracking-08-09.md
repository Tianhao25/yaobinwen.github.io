> I was really surprised to see I had never spent that much time on English learning...

Since I went to the [Master of Software Engineering](http://mse.isri.cmu.edu/software-engineering/web4-distance/MSE/index.html) program of Carnegie Mellon University, I've gotten used to recording my everyday time with [Toggl](https://toggl.com/), even if I've graduated from this program since last December. I want to get a better idea of how I spend the time of my day so I can find where my time leaks and whether I have spent sufficient time on the things I'm most interested in.

Today, when looking at the time reports of the last two month, August and September, I've been surprised, or kind of shocked, that I had never spent that much time on the things I always declare I'm interested in.

Here is the time tracking of them, from 08/01/2016 to 09/30/2016.
