On 09/26 I wrote a blog titled ["What Will I Be In Five Years?"](http://yaobinwen.github.io/archive/2016/09/26/What-will-I-be-in-5-years/) in which I listed several goals I want to achieve in the future. Today, I'm going to focus on the first two - building a good reputation and network in the IT industry - and think in depth about how I should approach to them. I will also reflect on what I haven't done well enough. Although I worked on this in [one of my One-Day-Hackathon projects](https://github.com/yaobinwen/one-day-hackathon/tree/master/projects/2016_09_28_approach_to_my_ideal_life), that one was merely a broad and kind of shallow view of all the problems and had never drilled into any of them.

So let me start.

The question is: **How can I build a good reputation in the IT industry?** In order to think systematically, I'll follow the framework below.

But **why do I want to do this?** Because a good reputation can help me find a job easily. If I have enough credits on my work, I may not even have to go through the interview process.

What is the key problem: **I don't know how to build up a good reputation.**

Why did I have this problem? Because I used to just focus on the technical aspects of my work and had never thought about the upstream and downstream of it.

Who are related to this problem? Myself.

What are related to this problem?

* My thinking model;
* My focus of career;
* My vision;
