My aunt asked me a question: Should we use the definite article "the" in the blank of the sentence below?

> They chose Tom to be ___ captain of the team.

The "standard" answer is: Yes, the "the" should be used here, but my aunt said that the "the" should be dropped if a person's title is used.

Quite confusing, I know. I searched on the Internet, and the quick conclusion is:
* **"Of course, there is an exception to every rule in English"**, said the [English Teacher Melanie](http://www.englishteachermelanie.com/grammar-when-not-to-use-the-definite-article/).
* Native speakers get confused by the rules, too.

In order to give a better and more complete answer, first of all, we need to understand what is a ```title```. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title) is a list of popular titles according to Wikipedia, such as:

> Mr. Mrs. Ms.

> Doctor (a person with a Ph.D degree)

> Senator, President

> King, Queen, Prince, Princess

> Captain (used as the military title: 上尉)

Therefore, we usually do not use "the" when saying:

* **Prince** Charles is **Queen** Elizabeth's son.
* **President** Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.
* **Mr.** Green bought some flowers for his wife yesterday.

(The first two examples are excerpted from [here](http://www.edufind.com/english-grammar/definite-article/).)

However, in these examples, "the" is used before the title:

* **The Queen** will be opening a new music hall next month.
* **The Pope** is the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

(These examples are excerpted from [here](http://www.grammaring.com/the-definite-article-with-titles-and-positions).)

See more examples:

* Barthez has never been **the goalkeeper** for Crystal Palace FC.
* **The head of department** allowed me to retake the exam.

(These two examples are excerpted from [here](http://www.grammaring.com/the-definite-article-with-titles-and-positions).)

And

* Margrethe II is (the) Queen of Denmark.
* Donald was elected **chairman** of the board.

(These two examples are excerpted from [here](http://www.davidappleyard.com/english/articles.htm).)

It can be seen that the usage of "the" is no way to be a mathematical rule!!!

My rule-of-thumb is:
1. In the case of a title followed by a person's name, such as ```President Obama```, ```Prince Charles```, ```Mr. Green```, we should not use "the".
2. If only the title is mentioned and it is capitalized, such as ```The President gave a speech.```, ```The Queen will open...```, we should use "the".
3. When we are talking about a title/position in a group/team/organization, AND we do not use a person's name after it, AND the title/position is not capitalized, usually we can put the "the" before that, such as ```the captain of the team```, ```the goalkeeper for Crystal Palace FC```. In these cases, we are more likely emphasizing the singleness of this title/position.

Happy learning English!
