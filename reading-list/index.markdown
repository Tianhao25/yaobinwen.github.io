**My thoughts:** I believe decision making is very important to the daily work in software development. Software development is a combination of various skills and one should not treat it as merely technical work.|

## I plan to read...

**My thoughts:** I have to say I know almost nothing about DevOps, and this is exactly why I plan to read this book. After some Googling, I think DevOps is important to modern software development because it reflects the tendency that the software developers should understand more than just coding in order to do their tasks well, and thinking from the perspective of operation and coding for that is one of these skills.|

**My thoughts:** This book covers a lot of C programming skills! More importantly, it is a humorous book!!! I have never expected that a tech book could be so funny and made me laugh when reading! I still remember the "E.I.E.I.O" command joke.|
