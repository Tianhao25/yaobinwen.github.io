# Readings

This page lists the books, articles, papers, essays, talks, etc. that I consider valuable.

## Reading in Progress

#### [Evaluating Project Decisions: Case Studies in Software Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VRZPHS/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2VGMNARANNIG&coliid=I35GDOUJDKYF8B)

I believe decision making is very important to the daily work in software development. Software development is a combination of various skills and one should not treat it as merely technical work.

## Plan to Read

#### [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&coliid=I2L0YPFTCKDPQO&colid=2VGMNARANNIG&qid=&sr=)

I have to say I know almost nothing about DevOps, and this is exactly why I plan to read this book. After some Googling, I think DevOps is important to modern software development because it reflects the tendency that the software developers should understand more than just coding in order to do their tasks well, and thinking from the perspective of operation and coding for that is one of these skills.

#### [DevOps: Learn One of the Most Powerful Software Development Methodologies FAST AND EASY!](http://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Powerful-Software-Development-Methodologies-ebook/dp/B0170ME48E/ref=sr_1_13?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1458949354&sr=1-13&keywords=devops)
