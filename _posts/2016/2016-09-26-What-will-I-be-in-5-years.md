> Hmm.. I don't know...

I asked this question today because it came to me when I was listening to a TED talk: [Why open a school? To close a prison](http://www.ted.com/talks/nadia_lopez_why_open_a_school_to_close_a_prison). The speaker asked her son: "Young man, where do you see yourself in five years?"

She wasn't intentional to ask this question to me, but I caught it. And I realized my answer would be:

"I don't know."

Well, I didn't become panic when I realized I don't know where I would be in five years, but I definitely wasn't feeling comfortable because, generally speaking, people at my age, 33, are supposed to know more or less clearly about their directions. In my case, when I look into my future, I can see a vast blank space only, a total void.

When I calm down, I can still figure out several things that will very likely to happen unless something goes very very wrong with my life:

* Get married (and even have a baby).
* Move to a new apartment or house.
* Sleep on a very good bed frame.
* Earn my tuition back.
* Speak very good English, like native.

This looks not good. What about the things which I wish to happen:

* Build up a good reputation in the IT industry.
* Build up a good network with the top engineers from all over the world.
* Not worry about my future.
* Make good money.
* Have been to Alaska and Japan.
* Find a good place for my parents so they can enjoy their latter part of life.
* Find people to play music with me.

Keep working hard as well as smart. I need to think about all of these things.
