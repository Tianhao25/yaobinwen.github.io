## Take-aways

* I spent about 41 hours on entertainment which was basically watching a lot of YouTube videos. What if I use these hours to share funny stories with my parents?
* Currently, "commute" is not really just travel. It's essentially my way of breaking away from any mentally intensive work. I can practice my English listening or learn something when I'm taking the bus or walking along the street, but I chose not to do that because I was already exhaustive after a whole day of work. That's a sort of entertainment without YouTube. I should count it as either "entertainment" or "task breaking" but not "commute". "Commute" should be the time that I travel but can't do anything else, such as driving the car.
* It's good that I spent a hefty portion of my free time on English learning. However, I should also start taking care of my personal life as I will have more and more commitments. From December, I should turn the "Life necessity" to yellow and "Try to reduce" to red. Yellow is not bad but should be watched closely as it will turn bad when it occupies too much of my time. Red is what I should try to minimize.
