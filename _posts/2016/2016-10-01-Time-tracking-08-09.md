> I was really surprised to see I had never spent that much time on English learning...

Since I went to the [Master of Software Engineering](http://mse.isri.cmu.edu/software-engineering/web4-distance/MSE/index.html) program of Carnegie Mellon University, I've gotten used to recording my everyday time with [Toggl](https://toggl.com/), even if I've graduated from this program since last December. I want to get a better idea of how I spend the time of my day so I can find where my time leaks and whether I have spent sufficient time on the things I'm most interested in.

Today, when looking at the time reports of the last two month, August and September, I've been surprised, or kind of shocked, that I had never spent that much time on the things I always declare I'm interested in.

Here is the time tracking of August.

Here is the time tracking of September.

### Breakdown Analysis

In general, I've spent **1/3** of my time on sleep, **1/3** on work, and the remaining **1/3** on all the other stuff. This is quite normal and probably is how every one having a full-time job spends their time.

On average, I spend **7.8 hours** on sleep every day, which is sufficient (and thus I'm happy about it); I spend roughly **8.75 hours** on my work every day, which is my responsibility.

In August, I spent **38 hours** on entertainment, primarily including:

* **7 hours** of baseball game (including a dinner) with pals of [Asian Professional Pittsburgh meet-up](https://www.meetup.com/Asian-Professionals-Pittsburgh/);
* **5 hours** of Coldplay concert;
* **5 hours** of video games;
* **16 hours** of YouTube videos; (TOO MUCH!)
* **1 hour** of watching movie. (I don't even remember which movie I watched...)

In September, I spent **17 hours** on entertainment, primarily including:

* **13 hours** of YouTube videos;
* **2 hours** of a live concert in University of Pittsburgh.

I believe some entertainment is very necessary to the personal life, but I don't want to spend that much time on YouTube videos anymore. I should try to go watch more movies with my friends, or play pool, or go to a bar, or anything I can interact with a human being.

In both months, I spent roughly **37 hours** on lunch and dinner. Pretty consistent. That's **1.23 hours** per day. Looks reasonable.

In September I spent about **26 hours** on commute. Usually I don't do anything at this time either because I was talking to someone else or simply because I was tired. However, I think I should try to utilize this time better. In August, I spent **17 hours** on commute, probably because I took more buses.

In August, I spent about **31.5 hours** on my personal projects and **22.5 hours** on English learning, while in September that is **47 hours** and **24 hours**, respectively. Looks better because the time was increased. However, I still feel a little bit frustrated when I realize it's **no more than 3 days** in total.

I also spend time on reading and writing. Most of the reading and writing time was spent on my morning diary, in which I briefly plan the whole day and reflect on myself. In both months I spent about **7.5 hours** to write morning diary. However, I could feel that this is becoming a thing I try to accomplish as a routine, instead of an opportunity that I look inside and talk to myself. I should probably do something about it.

### Summary

The tracking information reveals something I didn't realize before:

* The work is really an important part of life! It literally takes up 1/3 of my life so I should really make my work an approach to greater achievement, instead of just a thing to make money.
* Do **NOT** completely rely on the remaining 1/3 of a day to work on my personal goals. Try to make the day-time job a complementary time to help my own goals.
* On the other hand, I should better utilize my after-work time for my personal goals. For example, I can:
    * Try to use the commute time to listen to more English;
    * Spend more time on entertainment of better quality, such as movies or sports or bar with friends, instead of staying alone;
    * Try to utilize my dining time for reading if reading while eating doesn't affect my digestion that much.

See how much I can improve in October.
