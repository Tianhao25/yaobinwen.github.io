> Things get better (?)

It's been another month since I [blogged about my time usage of August and September](http://yaobinwen.github.io/archive/2016/10/01/Time-tracking-08-09/). Now it's time to review the usage of October.

Here is the time tracking of October.

### Breakdown Analysis

* Total hours: 744 (= 24 hours per day * 31 days) (100.0%)
    * Unlogged hours: 5 (0.7%)
    * Logged hours: 739 (99.3%)
        * Sleep: 265 (35.9%)
        * Work: 212 (28.7%)
        * Free time: 262 (35.5%)

I want to pay more attention to the **Free time** sector because that's what I have the total control. The free time usage of October was:

Among which:

* **Self-improvement** includes all the additional work and study, which is the sector that I should try to maximize.
* **Life necessity** includes all the things I need to do to keep my daily life running normally, such as taking care of my health insurance, video chatting with my family. I don't worry about this sector no matter how much time it takes because it is necessary.
* **Try to reduce** includes the entertainment, lunch & dinner time, and commute. They are surely necessary, but currently I'm not making them "good" enough. For example, I usually watch brainless YouTube videos for entertainment. However, I prefer to do something better entertainment such as watching a good movie with my friends. Or, when having lunch or dinner, I should have watched some online course videos to make the time better used. I will need to try to minimize this part of time.
* **Others** includes the random things that are not under my complete control. Sometimes it's just hard to manage them.

In general, the time usage looks good.

### Summary

* It's good to see that I've spent the major part of my free time on Self-improvement. I should try to stick to it.
* I still need to work to reduce the amount of time of entertainment, lunch & dinner, as well as commute. For example, I can take more bus to save more time for self-improvement.
