> Sense of presence: Find the connections hidden behind things.

Today I read the article titled "George Soros: What You Can't Learn From a College"[1] and it puts forward a concept: ```Sense of presence```.

The **sense of presence**, as for my understanding from reading the article, requires a person to know well about the social and physical environment around him/her, and, more importantly, to understand the connections that hide behind them so to have a total mastery of what would be likely to happen next when something happens. As a result of this mastery, this person can act proactively instead of reacting to the changes.

This sounds like ```unagi``` an awful lot.

The author says that George Soros was always trying to cultivate his capability of figuring out how an event that occurs in one place will eventually affect another faraway place. I don't know if George Soros actually said or not that because I can't find any authentic reference of that saying. Nevertheless, I still think this is an insightful idea about how and what we should learn, because in this era of everybody being overwhelmed by information, we are so easily confused, frightened or misled by what we see, aka the "facts", unless we can see the connection behind them so to prepare ourselves before any possible bad results happen.

One way of testing whether you have the "sense of presence" at this moment is to take part in the [examination from the future](https://www.ft.com/content/581fd4ca-734c-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35) designed by Gideon Rachman, because the questions in this exam are asking about the things that are going on globally at present.

The author says the people without the sense of presence are like the leaves drifting on the sea: They just can't control where they are going and they don't know why. I don't want to get into such a situation.

I learned three things after reading this article:

* First, when we are learning about the historical events, we should not only focus on what actually happened but, more importantly, also learn how those events affected the other contemporaneous events as well as our current world.
* Second, I should probably have just a limited scope to focus on to train my sense of presence because the world is so large and I can't see everything. I plan to learn more about the following domains:
  * New energy;
  * Energy management;
  * Public health management;
  * Mining;
  * Artificial intelligence.
