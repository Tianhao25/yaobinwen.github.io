Recently I participated a marketing survey in order to develop the marketing strategic position. Although the survey was long enough to make it a headache, I believe I can learn a lot by "reverse-engineering" it to see why it was those questions asked but not some others. The questions asked reflect what aspects are important for developing a market plan.

## Survey Summary

The entire survey consists of 26 sections. For the sake of confidentiality, I can't copy and paste the original text but summarize them here.

1. Your personal information.
2. What issues are important to your company's success? Some major ones include:
  * Find prospects;
  * Find partners;
  * Develop new markets;
  * Create stronger brand recognition;
  * Create strong public visibility (publication, newsletter, etc.);
  * Make a certain revenue;
  * Develop more penetration to the existing markets;
  * Attract good employees;
3. What others issues are important to your company's success?
4. What is the core competency of your company?
5. What is the profile of the ideal prospect?
6. What, such as accomplishment or capability, do you want a prospect to know about your company?
7. What are the indicators of good marketing or sales opportunities?
8. What specific achievements should your company make?
9. What specifically can you do to help your company achieve the goals?
10. What products/services should your company emphasize?
11. What is the core selling proposition that differentiates your company from others?
12. Rank the values/benefits your company should bring to a client.
13. What countries should your company expand the business to?
14. What is the profile of an "ideal" client?
15. Who are the key decision makers in a prospective client and what are important to them?
16. If your company doesn't exist, what other companies might your clients choose?
17. Why do you think the prospects/clients should choose your company?
18. What publications do you want to write to to publicize the company?
19. What are the strengths of the company that attract prospects?
20. What are the weaknesses of the company that make the clients/prospects go to a competitor?
21. What are the major marketing opportunities?
22. What are the major marketing threats?
23. How would you, if given a certain amount of money, invest it into the company development?
24. What are the core obstacles that prevent the company from maximizing the market penetration?
25. Rank the following marketing methods.
26. What can you do in terms of marketing to help the company succeed?

## Survey Analysis

These 26 sections can be merged into several categories. These categories represent the entities to be considered when developing the market plan:

* About the company:
  * The important issues relevant to success;
  * The core competency;
  * The weaknesses;
  * The values/benefits brought to the clients;
  * What should be known to the prospects;
* About the marketing:
  * The indicators of good opportunities;
  * The threats & obstacles;
* About clients/prospects:
  * Their characteristics (the persona);
  * Who are their key decision makers and what are important to them?
* About you:
  * What you can do;

## My Thoughts

* Do these questions only work for market plan development? How about using them to perform a full analysis of a company's business environment?
