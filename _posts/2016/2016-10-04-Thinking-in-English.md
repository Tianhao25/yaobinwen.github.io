> It's a quite simple concept, and I know it very well, but never do it well.

Today I watched Benny Lewis' TEDxSanAntonio talk [Fluent in Three Months - Rapid Language Hacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZqUeWshwMs), in which he basically talked about just one thing, but one very important thing, about learning a language quickly and well: **just use it throughout your life**.

Using it throughout your life, as for my understanding, is not just in some particular circumstances or when doing some particular tasks, but (trying to use it) in **EVERY ASPECT AND MOMENT** of your life. In other words, you should try to squeeze the space of using your native language as hard as possible.

Pretty simple idea, and I understand it very well, but have never done it well enough.

This is why I'm trying to blog and write my morning diary in English. I can't avoid using my native language, Chinese, completely because I have a roommate and two colleagues who are all Chinese, but I'll continue to try.
