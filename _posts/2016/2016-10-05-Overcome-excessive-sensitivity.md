> Being anxious to publish your work is also a kind of excessive sensitivity.

This morning when I was lying on my bed and immersed myself in some random thoughts, **I suddenly realized that I was always and am still excessively sensitive to other people's criticism.**

I knew I always was. For example, when I was still a kid and drawing a picture on a piece of paper, I was always trying to hide it from the others unless I was personally satisfied with my drawing. Or, when I'm writing software code, I am always hesitant to demonstrate my work to others unless I am personally satisfied with it.

The problem is: never do I seem to be satisfied with my work, thus never actually show them to others.

I read an article titled "Your Excessive Sensitivity Puts You Increasingly Mediocre"([《你越来越普通，是因为过度的羞耻感》](http://tinyurl.com/hkyhf3z) written in Chinese) from WeChat several weeks ago. The primary point of this article is that a person's excessive sensitivity prevents him/her from making his/her work known to others hence he/she loses a lot of communication and is unable to improve from exchanged ideas.

I agreed, and thus started to try to share more of my work to others. But this morning, I realized I failed to do so. This is also why I'm feeling quite lonely at my work. I want to find more friends that share the common goals, but so far I haven't.

As a measure to improve the situation, I will try to share more on Twitter and mention the relevant people. I can also publish my articles on some well-known platform such as [Medium](https://medium.com/). Hopefully I can hear more feedback from others and find what I should keep working on.
