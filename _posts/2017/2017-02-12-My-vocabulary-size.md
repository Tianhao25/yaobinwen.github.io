> Glad to know I'm already 5 years old!

Today I took a test of English vocabulary, and [here](http://testyourvocab.com/result?user=7863647) is my result. If it is no longer available, you can look at the following screenshot:

Then I looked at the [_"Native speakers in greater detail"_](http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2013-05-08-Native-speakers-in-greater-detail#newMainchartNative) report and found the following statistical fact:

See? According to the statistical results posted on May 2013, a 5-year-old English native speaker has the same vocabulary size as me.

Glad to know I'm still **SO** young!

The above post also says "Most native English adult speakers who have taken the test fall in the range **20,000â€“35,000 words**."

All right... I still have a long way to go.
