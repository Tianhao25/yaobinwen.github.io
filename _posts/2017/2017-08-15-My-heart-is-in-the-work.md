> "My Heart Is In The Work" - Andrew Carnegie, founder of Carnegie Mellon University

For the pass three years, I've always interpreted "My Heart Is In The Work" as a, kind of, paraphrase of "workaholic": If somebody's whole heart is in the work, what would we expect from him/her about personal life?

But these days I've been facing my own career "crisis". Not that serious yet, but pretty close. I realize I have no idea what I should do in the future. Surely, it will be some technical work as I'm a software programmer and I so far have so other skills to make a living. But what specific area should I focus on? Web development? Artificial intelligence? Desktop application development? The everlasting changing environment makes me feel anxious and lost, and this anxiety has somewhat hindered my performance in my job: I sometimes can't find a reason to let me make effort and invest my time to learn the technology used in work, because I'm not sure if the technology would still be useful in the future.

When I reviewed these words said by Andrew Carnegie about a century ago, I suddenly realized I can look at it from a different perspective: **"My Work Reflects My Heart"**. Work is usually not easy. In fact, it can be very difficult, boring, and stressful. Working in such conditions do reflect the attitude of the doer towards all the things. If somebody treats the work perfunctorily, how do you expect him/her to treat the life seriously and appropriately when the life comes to the hard time?

Treating the work seriously, and more importantly, appropriately, is a way to improve one's capability of dealing with the hard parts of one's life. Building this capability has two benefits: One will be able to deal with the hard time better, and he/she will build trust from others when they see his/her attitude towards work.
