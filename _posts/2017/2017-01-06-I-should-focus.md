> I should strive to get some things done instead of start many new things...

Yes, I should strive to get some things done, completely!

I know I'm an ambitious person and I want to achieve many things. However, a skyscraper starts with its base, and Rome wasn't built in a day. I must actually get some things done, instead of start many things and leave them unfinished and forgotten.

One possible reason that prevents me from getting things done is that I didn't use the divide-and-conquer strategy to do my work. I always set a big goal which although shows my ambition but also unconsciously frightens me because deep in my heart I know such a big target is almost unreachable.

This is also partially why I started the "One-Day-Hackathon" as a means of breaking big work into smaller pieces.

If I think something is big and frightening, it's probably because I didn't think of it clearly, or my current goal has put me in the panic zone. For example, I always want to practice my English hard enough to be able to finish reading an English novel, but this is practically a mission impossible at present. More realistically, I should have set a very small goal, such as reading just 10 pages of the novel regardless how thick the whole book is, to make some progress while still giving me a feeling of achievement. I should also practice delegating some work to others.

Anyway, I need to get some things done.
